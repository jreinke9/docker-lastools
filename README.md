# Lastools docker image

A docker image that includes both the open and closed source binaries for the
Lastools toolchain. Compared to the other Lastools docker images out there, this
one runs the windows binaries directly using Wine.

## Usage

```bash
docker run hakonamdal/lastools <cmd> <args>
```

Replace `<cmd>` with whatever Lastool binary you want to use.

To see all available tools, run the image without any arguments:

```bash
docker run hakonamdal/lastools
```

In order to actually access your local files, you need to map your current
directory into the running container by adding the `-v $(pwd):/lastools` argument
to `docker run`. This will map the current directory to the working directory
of the docker container. A typical command will, therefore, look like:

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd):/lastools" lastools las2las -i input.laz -o output.las
```
